# variables through to the remote process. OpenSSH client/server can be
# configured allow specific whitelisted variables to be passed from `ssh`'s
# environment into the environment of the remote process, but does not
# do this by default.
#
# The exec_prefix and batch_submit_cmd attributes undergo template expansion
# in BatchSpawner, so we can use Jinja2 templating features to insert
# all environment variables. After template rendering, the full command
# exec_prefix + batch_submit_cmd is run in a shell with environment specified
# by the result of the Spawner class's get_env() function.
#
# `batch_submit_cmd` needs to submit the job using `sbatch`, passing the
# environment variables in template variable keepvars through from the
# environment of the `batch_submit_cmd` to the single-user
# Jupyter server running in the Slurm job. As `sbatch` is being run via `ssh`,
# it does not share the same environment as the `ssh` process (specified by
# get_env()). In this case we expand the environment variables in `keepvars`
# in the environment of the `ssh` process and then explicitly set their values
# as arguments for an `env`/`sudo` command to setup the appropriate environment
# for `sbatch` to pass through to the Slurm job.
#
# NOTE: Care must be taken with quoting! The exec_prefix + batch_submit_cmd is
# run in a shell. Since the command run by the shell is `ssh ... <cmd>`, parameter
# expansion and quote removal occur in the context the `ssh` command is run, not
# in the context where the `<cmd>` is run. This is particularly important as
# some of the `JUPYTERHUB_*` environment variables in keepvars contain quotes
# themselves! In general, any portion of the command run by SSH that should be
# considered a single argument but might be split by the shell should be
# double-quoted, so that only the outer quotes are removed when the
# `ssh ... <cmd>` is processed by the shell.
